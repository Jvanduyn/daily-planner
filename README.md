# Multi-choice quiz using Javascript    

## Description

During this project, I wanted to be able to put my Javascript skills to the test. This web app will allow users to take view a daily schedule planner that they can store information as a reminder of what they need to get done on an hourly basis. They will be able to see the current hour, past hours, and future hours based on the color coordination. They are also able to see the current time on the top of the web page.  

- My motivation for this project was to be able to put some of my Javascript skills into on larger scale project. I wanted to be able to make a fun and interactive way to show off my web api and javascript abilities. This was also a practical way to use a real web app for practical use.
- I built this project because I wanted to have anyone be able to use an easy to use project that I built. 
- This will be a practical way for the user to use a project that I built. 
- During this project I learned how to be able to impliment different practices into one large function and be able to practice my skills with local storage.

## Credits

During this project, I collaborated with two people I would like to thank. 

First I collaborated with my fellow classmate Alexander. He and I were able to get most of the project working together minus a few issues with the local storage. I would also like to thank a classmate tyler who was able to help me understand how to pull the stored information and display it on the page for the local storage. 

Lastly I was able to work with a tutor of mine Vinnie Lopez. He was able to really help me polish the project off by getting the code working perfectly, and being able to consolidate most of the code to make it functioning properly.

## Features

This project allows a user to view a 9-5 workday planner and be able to add and store information as needed as a reminder to get things done throughout the day. 

The user will be able to see the current time of day, and see what is the current hour, future hours, and past hours based off a color code system. 
- They will be able to save any custom text under whichever code block they select. 
- If they save the text on the page, they will be able to revisit the site and have it still be there.
